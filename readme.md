I am currently in a Software Degree Apprenticeship at Google, with the external training provider being Makers Academy. In my role, I work on the Google Fit Android App, for wear and for phones. I work on fixing bugs, changing UI, and improving accessibility. Currently, I work more on the back end of Google. This includes database work, timezone work, and SQL. 


In my spare time, I like to create computer games to make people happy. Additionally, I enjoy doing mini coding projects. For instance, creating a [discord bot to query a minecraft server](https://github.com/etelan/MinecraftServerQueryDiscordBot), and a [Minecraft Trainline Website with Springboot API](https://alexisbaker.uk/TrainBlock-Site/). Additionally, for my coursework at Sixth Form, I created an app for a local cafe.
