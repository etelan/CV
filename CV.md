I am currently in a Software Engineering Degree Apprenticeship at Google, in partnership with the external training provider Makers Academy. In my core role, I work on the Google Fit Android App, which connects Google Wear wearables with users' smartphones. My work leans more toward the backend services that support Google Wear. This includes database work, writing SQL queries, and implementation of timezone functionality. I also undertake UI development, create accessibility improvements, and write bug fixes.

In my spare time, I like to create computer games to make people happy. This has branched out into mini coding projects. My latest projects have included creating a [discord bot to query a Minecraft server](https://github.com/etelan/MinecraftServerQueryDiscordBot), and as an excuse to learn the Springboot API a [Minecraft/Trainline Website which interfaces with a virtual railway inside a Minecraft instance](https://alexisbaker.uk/TrainBlock-Site/). Prior to beginning my apprenticeship at Google, I created an app for a local cafe using Gamemaker Studio, programming it in Game Maker Language.
