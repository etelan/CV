I am currently in a Software Engineering Degree Apprenticeship at Google, in partnership with the external training provider Makers Academy. In my core role, I work on the Google Fit Android App, which connects Google Wear wearables with user's smartphones. My work leans more toward the backend services that support Google Wear. This includes database work, writing SQL queries, and implementation of timezone functionality. I also undertake some work on UI updates, accessibility improvements, and bug fixes.

In my spare time, I like to create computer games to make people happy. This has branched out into mini coding projects. My latest projects have included creating a [discord bot to query a Minecraft server](https://github.com/etelan/MinecraftServerQueryDiscordBot), and a [Minecraft/Trainline Website using the Springboot API](https://alexisbaker.uk/TrainBlock-Site/). Prior to beginning my apprenticeship at Google, I created an app for a local cafe using Gamemaker Studio, programming it in Game Maker Language.
